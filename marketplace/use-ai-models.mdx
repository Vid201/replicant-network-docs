Each successfully created AI model on the Replicant Network is available for use - be it publicly crowdfunded or privately funded. Models can easily be used through the simplified and user-friendly interface.

As mentioned in the [Tokenization](/marketplace/tokenization) section, each model is tokenized and users can purchase the model tokens. Models tokens are needed to use the model - based on the number of tokens you own, you can use the model for a certain number of calls/inferences.

Another way to use the model is to pay for a subscription to the platform. More information about the pricing can be found in the [Pricing](/marketplace/pricing) section.

## API

In the future, each model will have an API endpoint that you can use to use the model.
