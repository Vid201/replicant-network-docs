> Hello human. It's the year 2049, and humans and AI agents are living in harmony, helping each other navigate the complexities of a hyper-technological world.
>
> Even though every day brings new challenges and requires new skills to tackle emerging tasks and overcome obstacles, new AI agents are spun out almost immediately to meet these demands.
>
> Thanks to the Replicant Network, humans and AI agents can collaborate seamlessly, commission new AI models, and fund their developmentâ€”whether individually or collectively. Meanwhile, in the shadows of the cyberpunk world, some push the boundaries to create the ultimate AI model, shaped by demand and necessity.

## About Replicant Network

Creating AI models is hard - from scratch or even fine-tuning - and requires technical skills and deep expertise to get really good models. As AI is becoming more and more integrated into our lives and AI agents are slowly taking over the internet, it will be important for us to get and use the models at our disposal.

Replicant Network is a platform to get the model you need through a crowdfunding or private bounty approach. Request the model you need, pay for it, and with just the right incentive, the model will be created. By helping with the model creation - either by funding or developing it - you get rewarded through shared revenue streams. We believe everyone should get the model they need for their life, work, or just for fun, and participate in the new AI economy.

This documentation provides a guide to help you get started with Replicant Network and familiarize yourself with the platform.
