## Extensible by Design

Protocols are supported through **toolkits** - each toolkit defines the interfaces to interact with crypto protocols. Since our AI agents are built on LangChain, toolkits work as extensions to LangChain plugins.

Our **toolkit-based architecture** makes it incredibly easy to add new capabilities:
