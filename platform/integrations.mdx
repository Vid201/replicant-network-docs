Protocols are supported on the Replicant Network through toolkits - each toolkit defines the interfaces to interact with crypto protocols. Because AI agents on the Replicant Network are based on LangChain, toolkits can be seen as extensions to LangChain plugins.

All the toolkits are open-sourced and most of them are developed internally by the core team. However, the community can add support for new protocols and integrations by contributing new toolkits to the GitHub repository. In the future, there will also be a marketplace where the community will be able to crowdfund new integrations.
