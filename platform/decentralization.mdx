Replicant Network will be decentralized progressively. We believe that in order to scale the product faster, it is not feasible to decentralize every component of the stack from the beginningâ€”especially since, with AI, full decentralization is not currently possible. Therefore, the platform will undergo a gradual decentralization process. Ultimately, our goal is to make Replicant Network an ever-living hyperstructure.
