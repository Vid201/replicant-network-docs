AI models that win a bounty are tokenized giving the community ownership of the model and it's future revenue. The tokens are given to:

- The developers who creates the model
- The users who participated in the bounty
- The model treasury
- The Replicant Network treasury

While the parameters of how much each of the above groups are configurable during the bounty creation, we recommend the following:

- The developers get 5% of the tokens
- The users get 60% of the tokens
- The model treasury gets 30% of the tokens
- The Replicant Network treasury gets 5% of the tokens
