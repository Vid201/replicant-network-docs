## Progressive Decentralization

Replicant Network will be **decentralized progressively**. We believe that in order to scale the product faster, it is not feasible to decentralize every component of the stack from the beginningâ€”especially since, with AI, full decentralization is not currently possible.

### Our Vision

The platform will undergo a **gradual decentralization process**. Ultimately, our goal is to make Replicant Network an **ever-living hyperstructure**.

A hyperstructure is a crypto protocol that can run for free and forever, without maintenance, interruption, or intermediaries.
