AI models are the brains of the AI agents. The better the model, the better the agent. 

Once the model is created on the Replicant Network, it can be used by the AI agents. While this is still in the early stage, we envision that the AI agents created with various agent frameworks (elizaOS, RIG, etc.) will be able to use the models created on the Replicant Network.
