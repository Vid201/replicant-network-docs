The life cycle of a model on Replicant Network is as follows:

1. Request a new model by creating a bounty (which can be either a public crowdfund or private) with a description of the model you want to create.
2. Participate in a bounty by funding it and specifying the example prompts. If the bounty is public, other users can join the bounty.
3. After the bounty is funded (more than xxx tokens are collected), the bounty transitions to the development phase.
4. The model is created/trained by the AI developers in the Replicant Network community. Developers submit their models when they are ready.
5. After the development phase is over, users participating in the bounty can vote for the best model. Prompts given in the step 2 are used on models.
6. The best model wins the bounty. Developers gets paid, model is added to the Replicant Network, and is tokenized.
7. The model is ready to be used on the Replicant Network.
