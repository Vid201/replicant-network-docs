Replicant Network operates through four key phases to facilitate AI model creation and incentivization. Below is an overview of the process:

## 1. Publish Phase
- **Step 1:** A user creates a crowdfunding campaign via `RepNetManager`.
- **Step 2:** Metadata is stored in decentralized storage.
- **Step 3:** An ERC20 token is deployed using `ERC20Factory`.

## 2. Funding Phase
- **Step 4:** Users fund the campaign by contributing money.
- **Step 5:** ERC20 tokens are minted as rewards for contributors.

## 3. Submission Phase
- **Step 6:** AI engineers submit models to decentralized storage.
- **Step 7:** Submissions are validated by `$RN` token holders.
- **Step 8:** Approved submissions are managed by `RepNetManager`.

## 4. Voting Phase
- **Step 9:** Funders load submitted models via an AI inference service.
- **Step 10:** Funders test the models.
- **Step 11:** Funders vote for the best model using `RepNetManager`.
- **Step 12:** The winning AI engineer is rewarded.

This streamlined workflow ensures collaboration, transparency, and fair rewards for all participants in the AI economy.
