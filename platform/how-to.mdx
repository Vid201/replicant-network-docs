## Getting Started

### 1. Connect Your Wallet
First, connect your wallet to the Replicant Network platform. We support all major Web3 wallets on Base Network.

### 2. Start Chatting with Replicant Network Agents
Once connected, simply type what you want to do. Our AI agent understands natural language and will handle all the technical details.

## Example Commands

<CodeGroup>
```text Basic Queries
"What can you do?"
"What's in my wallet?"
"What tokens do I have?"
```

```text Token Transfers
"Send 10 USDC to 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D8Cc4b4C7C8B8B8B"
"Transfer 0.5 ETH to alice.eth"
"Send all my DEGEN tokens to my friend's address"
```

```text Token Swaps
"Swap 100 USDC for ETH"
"Exchange 0.1 ETH to USDC"
"Convert all my DAI to USDC"
```

```text Chain Operations
"Swap 50 USDC for ETH, then send 0.01 ETH to my friend"
"Convert half my ETH to USDC and send 100 USDC to this address"
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
**New to crypto?** Don't worry! Just ask the agent questions like "What is a token swap?" or "How do gas fees work?" - it will explain everything in simple terms.
</Tip>

## How It Works

1. **Type your request** in natural language
2. **Agent analyzes** what you want to do
3. **Agent shows preview** - A detailed card appears in chat with transaction details, fees, and potential outcomes
4. **Confirm in chat** - Review and approve the transaction within the agent interface
5. **Wallet confirmation** - Your wallet prompts for final authorization
6. **Agent completes** the transaction and reports back with results

<Info>
**Double Safety**: The agent always shows you exactly what will happen before anything is executed. You get two chances to review - first in the chat interface, then in your wallet.
