Replicant Network is a platform where you can:
- request and create a bounty for a new custom model
- participate in existing bounties
- use custom AI models

Models on the platform are tokenized and owned by users, meaning that users collectively participate in governance decisions about model evolution as well as receive a revenue share when the model is used.

More information about the whole workflow can be found in the [Workflow](/platform/workflow) section.
