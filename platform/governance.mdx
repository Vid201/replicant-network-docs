Replicant Network is governed by its community, embracing the principles and ethos of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Governance is open to $RN token holders, AI agent developers, community members, and other stakeholders, all of whom can participate in shaping the future of the platform. This inclusive approach ensures that decisions are made collectively, reflecting the diverse interests and expertise within the Replicant Network ecosystem.
