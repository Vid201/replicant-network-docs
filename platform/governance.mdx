Each successfully completed bounty results in a new AI model that is tokenized, with tokens being distributed to the participants in the bounty. The goal of the Replicant Network is to give ownership of the AI models to the community, who should decide about the evolution of the model. Tokens holders will have the following rights:

- Earn a revenue share when the model is used
- Participate in the governance decisions about the model, including but not limited to:
  - Choosing whether to retrain the model on new data
  - Choosing whether to completely replace the model with a new one
  - Other decisions that are related to the model's evolution

Because part of the tokens are reserved for the model treasury, token holders can provide additional incentive for updating the model.
