## Community-Driven Innovation

In the future, there will be **numerous AI agents**, each responsible for a specific task or protocol within the Web3 ecosystem. Since a single team cannot keep up with the development and support of all possible agents and models, Replicant Network will introduce a **crowdfunding marketplace**.

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Community Identifies Need">
    Users propose new AI agents, models, or integrations they want to see built
  </Step>
  <Step title="Crowdfunding Campaign">
    Community members contribute funds to support development of requested features
  </Step>
  <Step title="Development & Delivery">
    Approved projects are built by community developers or core team
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ownership Distribution">
    Contributors receive ownership stakes in the AI agents they helped fund
  </Step>
</Steps>
