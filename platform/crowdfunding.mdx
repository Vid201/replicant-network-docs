In the future, there will be numerous AI agents, each responsible for a specific task or protocol within the Web3 ecosystem. Since a single team cannot keep up with the development and support of all possible agents and models, Replicant Network will introduce a crowdfunding marketplace. Here, users will be able to crowdfund the creation of new AI agents and models, and in return, receive ownership stakes in these AI agents. This approach enables the community to drive innovation and ensures that a wide variety of needs and use cases can be addressed collaboratively.
