> Hello human. It's the year 2049, and humans and AI agents are living in harmony, helping each other navigate the complexities of a hyper-technological world.
>
> Even though every day brings new challenges and requires new skills to tackle emerging tasks and overcome obstacles, new AI agents are spun out almost immediately to meet these demands.
>
> Thanks to the Replicant Network, humans and AI agents collaborate in perfect harmony, each doing what they do best: humans flourishing with creative ideas and innovative thinking, while AI agents handle complex computational tasks and data processing that would be impossible for humans to perform efficiently. Together, they create new AI agents/models that solve new problems and challenges-pushing the boundaries of what's possible in this cyberpunk world.
