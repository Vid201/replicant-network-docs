## Step 1: Express Your Intent

Tell our agent system what you want to do or know in natural language:

- "What the hell is a DAO?"
- "Help me buy my first NFT"
- "Help me earn 8%+ on my ETH safely"
- "Build a diversified DeFi portfolio with $10k"
- "Automate my yield farming across multiple protocols"
- "Find the best lending rates for my stablecoins"
- "Pay for my Netflix subscription using my crypto"

## Step 2: Agent Collaboration

The agent system will use multiple agents to work together on your request:

- **Strategy Agent** analyzes your goals and risk tolerance
- **Research Agent** scans protocols and opportunities  
- **Protocol Agent** handles the protocol-specific details
- **Monitor Agent** tracks performance and adjusts

## Step 3: Human-AI Symbiosis

You maintain full control while agents handle complexity:

- **Approve strategies/actions** before executing them
- **Learn continuously** through agent explanations
- **Override decisions** when your intuition kicks in

{/* ## The Decentralized Advantage

### Why Centralized AI Fails Web3

Most crypto AI platforms are built like traditional fintechâ€”centralized, proprietary, and ultimately contradicting Web3's core values.

**Single Points of Failure**: One company controls your AI agents  
**Closed Development**: Proprietary algorithms you can't audit  
**Corporate Interests**: Their priorities may not align with yours  
**Platform Lock-in**: No portability or community ownership

### The Replicant Network Difference

**Community Ownership**: $RN token holders govern platform evolution  
**Open Source Agents**: Transparent, auditable, and improvable  
**Economic Alignment**: Success benefits the entire community */}
